# Contact Manager CLI (C#)

## 📌 Microsoft Summer Internship 2026  

---

## Project Overview

This project is a **Command-Line Contact Management System** developed in **C#**, designed to replace a legacy phone-book–style contact lookup system.
The application provides **efficient contact retrieval**, **extensible data storage**, and a **clean object-oriented architecture** following **SOLID principles**.
All contact data is stored locally using **JSON**, ensuring simplicity and flexibility.

---

## Problem Statement

The legacy contact lookup system suffers from:
- Slow and inefficient searching
- Rigid, non-extensible data storage
- Blocking operations during data loading

This application addresses these issues by providing a modern, structured, and maintainable solution implemented in **C#**.
